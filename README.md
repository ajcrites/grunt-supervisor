# grunt-supervisor

Run supervisor as a grunt task for easy configuration and integration with the rest of your workflow.

## Getting Started
If you haven't used grunt before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a gruntfile as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, install this plugin with this command:
```shell
npm install grunt-supervisor --save-dev
```

Then add this line to your project's `Gruntfile.js` gruntfile:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks( "grunt-supervisor" );
```
